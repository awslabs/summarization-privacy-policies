Therefore, by obtaining access to the group which contains the data point we need to identify you with and provide the WeatherPro Premium App to you, we technically obtain access to the contacts in your phone as well.

The Album tab helps users organize their photos and videos by location and common tags. The People tab organizes photos and videos by faces. When you import photos and videos that include location attributes, the Photos app can group your photos and videos by time and location. To do so, the Photos app sends location data in your photos and videos to Microsoft to determine the names of locations, such as \"Seattle, Washington.\" When you sign-in to the Photos app using your Microsoft account, and you have configured your system to synchronize your local device file system with OneDrive, Photos will use object detection to tag and sort your photos and videos into Albums. If you enable the “People” toggle on Photos Settings page, the app uses both face detection and face recognition technologies to organize your private collection into groups. Face detection is used to identify photos and videos containing faces. Face recognition groups photos and videos containing a given person’s face. You can choose to enable or disable grouping photos and videos by faces. If this feature is enabled, Photos’ background processes scan your photo and video collections stored on your device for facial groupings and present the results within Photos’ People tab on your device.

From the People tab, you can then choose to link facial groupings with your locally stored Contacts via the People Picker. You, and not Microsoft, are responsible for obtaining consent to link Contacts with your facial groupings, and you represent that you have obtained all necessary consents to link your photos and videos into groups. Your groupings will be stored on your device for as long as you elect to keep the groupings or the photos or videos.

{"text": " To help you understand required service data, the following is an example scenario using PowerPoint Designer, which is a connected experience you can use when creating slides for a presentation. PowerPoint Designer helps you improve your slides by automatically generating design ideas to choose from. While you're putting content on a slide, Designer works in the background to match that content to professionally designed layouts. The required service data that is sent to Microsoft to enable this connected experience for you could include the following: * Customer content, such as the text or images you added to your slide. * Functional data, such as which slide you are working on and its layout. * Service diagnostic data, such as events that tell us if the design idea was correctly applied to your slide and that the service calls were performing correctly. If you choose to disable the category of connected experiences that includes PowerPoint Designer, the feature will be turned off and none of this required service data is sent to us. See [Connected Experiences in Office](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2086626) for more information mainonedrivemodule Summary OneDrive lets you store and access your files on virtually any device. You can also share and collaborate on your files with others. Some versions of the OneDrive application enable you to access both your personal OneDrive by signing in with your personal Microsoft account and your OneDrive for Business by signing in with your work or school Microsoft account as part of your organization's use of Office 365. When you use OneDrive, we collect data about your usage of the service, as well as the content you store, to provide, improve, and protect the services. Examples include indexing the contents of your OneDrive documents so that you can search for them later and using location information to enable you to search for photos based on where the photo was taken. We also collect device information so we can deliver personalized experiences, such as enabling you to sync content across devices and roam customized settings. When you store content in OneDrive, that content will inherit the sharing permissions of the folder in which you store it. For example, if you decide to store content in the public folder, the content will be public and available to anyone on the internet who can find the folder. If you store content in a private folder, the content will be private. When you share content to a social network like Facebook from a device that you have synced with your OneDrive account, your content is either uploaded to that social network, or a link to that content is posted to that social network. Doing this makes the content accessible to anyone on that social network. To delete the content, you need to delete it from the social network (if it was uploaded there, rather than a link to it) and from OneDrive. When you share your OneDrive content with your friends via a link, an email with the link is sent to those friends. The link contains an authorization code that allows anyone with the link to access your content. If one of your friends sends the link to other people, they will also be able to access your content, even if you did not choose to share the content with them. To revoke permissions for your content on OneDrive, sign in to your account and then select the specific content to manage the permission levels. Revoking permissions for a link effectively deactivates the link. No one will be able to use the link to access the content unless you decide to share the link again. Files managed with OneDrive for Business are stored separately from files stored with your personal OneDrive. OneDrive for Business collects and transmits personal data for authentication, such as your email address and password, which will be transmitted to Microsoft and/or to the provider of your Office 365 service. mainoutlookmodule Summary Outlook products are designed to improve your productivity through improved communications and include Outlook.com, Outlook applications, and related services.", "summary": "* **Service Diagnostic Data** , which is the data required to keep the service secure, up to date, and performing as expected.

DSGVO Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. DSGVO if the data processing e.g. is required for us in the context of legal proceedings. The application process requires applicants to provide us with the applicant data.

Otherwise, if the application for a job offer is not successful, the applicants' data will be deleted. Applicants' data will also be deleted if an application is withdrawn, which the applicants are entitled to at any time.

For example, the operators may try to sell new service plans (which are phony) or they may tell you that they’re updating your account and want you to “confirm” details. Their goal is to trick you into releasing personal information like credit card numbers or social insurance numbers, which can then be used for further fraud. Another example is the use of a pre-recorded message promising customers travel rewards or a $100 credit on their next bill and directing customers to a fake site that “looks” like a legitimate site or a 1-800 number to try to trick customers into disclosing their personal information. If you get a suspicious call: * Do not give out your personal information. Legitimate companies will never call or email their customers requesting information such as passwords, bank account information or a credit card number, unless they are responding directly to an inquiry you know you have made.", "summary": "**Important tip:** Watch out for “suspiciously generous” offers and make sure you are dealing with a legitimate business when you make a purchase over the phone or the Internet.

Jibunu will only share data with third parties when absolutely necessary to complete our obligations for the research project. Third parties are under the same obligations of protecting your data and not using data for any other purpose than the initial intent of the research project. * Jibunu collects data you actively provide through the research tool and data you passively provide while using the tool such as cookies and IP address. * All data is collected and reported securely via https (the secure version of HTTP). Access to data is protected by an authentication process. Any information that is transmitted or backed up is encrypted and all connections to the data are encrypted. * You can opt out of the research project at any time and you can update your personal information at any time by emailing [support@jibunu.com](mailto:support@jibunu.com). Jibunu programs research tools such as online surveys and interview tools for market researchers. The data gathered from these tools is collected on behalf of our clients. Jibunu is committed to protecting the privacy of all information gathered, especially any and all personal information of research participants using these tools. Jibunu is also committed to protecting the personal information of any person using Jibunu’s website and reporting tools. This policy applies to all client and respondent personal information that we collect or use in the course of conducting our business. Research participants should also refer to the privacy policy of the research company or sample provider that invited you to participate in the research to fully understand how your data is used. We treat all information we receive from clients as confidential and do not use the information for any purpose other than to fulfill our obligations to those clients. We keep client information secure at all times, and have strict policies against the use and disclosure of it by our employees or any third parties. We collect data on behalf of our research clients for research purposes only, and our use of that information will be limited to that purpose. Jibunu will not rent, sell or share any information to any third party for the purpose of directly marketing any products or services. In some cases we may need to share information gathered with third parties that provide research services in support of the research project. An example of this may include things like having a translator translate open end comments into English. Any third party that receives personal information is obligated to follow all of the same privacy protection regulations as followed by Jibunu and the research company. Information is typically used and analyzed in aggregate, meaning that the data is combined together and analyzed as a whole to look for trends, impact, and general preferences. Under certain circumstances permitted or required by law (for example, in connection with law enforcement investigations), we may be required to disclose client data or personal information without giving notice. Personal information may be collected via two methods. The first method is actively through questions in the survey or research tool. The information gathered will depend on the needs of the researcher and research project. Information collected may include items such as your name, phone number, address, gender, ethnicity, income or other demographic data. Depending on the nature of the research these questions may also include items related to your health, lifestyle, personal preferences or other items. The second method is a passive collection that happens automatically through the system tools. Information gathered in this manner will include items regarding the device being used to access the online tools such as cookies, IP address, browser, browser version, operating system (Mac/PC/Windows), and referring pages. Certain information about Client, Surveys, Respondents or Respondents’ participation in a Survey that is derived, collected or generated by TrueSample for use by the TrueSample Technology may be collected and stored. Respondent Metadata specifically excludes the content of any Survey, the content of the responses to questions in any Survey (other than the SurveyScore rating question) and any personally identifiable information. Please review the TrueSample Privacy Policy at http://truesample.com/website-privacy-policy/ for more information. When collecting information on children under the age of 13, the research company is responsible for requesting consent from the parent or guardian of the child. This is usually, but not always, handled through question(s) in the survey. Jibunu will not actively request or collect information on or from a child under the age of 13 without consent. As a research participant you have the right to opt out of participating in any survey at any time. You can also opt out of receiving email notifications from the sender of the email. If Jibunu deployed the email notification on behalf of the researcher, you may choose to opt out of email notifications by clicking on the opt out link in the email. If you do this, Jibunu will add you to the opt out list and you will not receive any further communication from Jibunu for that study. This will not opt you out of all email notifications from that researcher or sample provider, or from Jibunu on behalf of other researchers. In order to opt out of all notifications from those companies, you must contact each company directly. You have the right to remove or change any of your personal information. To make changes to any personal information that Jibunu has collected, email us at support@jibunu.com and we will assist you to the best of our ability as quickly as possible. In most cases, Jibunu only associates data with a unique identifier without any other access or link to other personal information that the researcher may have. In such cases, we will send your request to the researcher and or sample provider. We maintain all necessary physical, electronic and procedural security measures to help safeguard data and personal information. Any information that is transmitted or backed up is encrypted and all connections to the data are encrypted. In addition, any interactions with the data require an authentication to gain access. Third parties that provide us with support or services are required to similarly protect personal information from unauthorized access. Data is kept for at least three years, or upon the agreed upon destruction date with the client. After that time, all data will be slated for destruction. Any data backups stored by Jibunu are encrypted prior to storage. Jibunu’s clients may have different policies for how they retain data.

{"text": " On this website, the controller has integrated components of the service Instagram. Instagram is a service that may be qualified as an audiovisual platform, which allows users to share photos and videos, as well as disseminate such data in other social networks. The operating company of the services offered by Instagram is Instagram LLC, 1 Hacker Way, Building 14 First Floor, Menlo Park, CA, UNITED STATES. With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and on which an Instagram component (Insta button) was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to the download of a display of the corresponding Instagram component of Instagram. During the course of this technical procedure, Instagram becomes aware of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by the data subject. If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Instagram, Instagram detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject—and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site—which specific sub-page of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This information is collected through the Instagram component and is associated with the respective Instagram account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the Instagram buttons integrated on our website, then Instagram matches this information with the personal Instagram user account of the data subject and stores the personal data. Instagram receives information via the Instagram component that the data subject has visited our website provided that the data subject is logged in at Instagram at the time of the call to our website. This occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on the Instagram button or not. If such a transmission of information to Instagram is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she can prevent this by logging off from their Instagram account before a call-up to our website is made. Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Instagram may be retrieved under <https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388> and <https://www.instagram.com/about/legal/privacy/>.", "summary": "**Data protection provisions about the application and use of Instagram**"}

{"text": " You can choose to share specific data (or all of the data) in a health record with other services, including participating third-party services you authorize. No service has access to your data through HealthVault unless an authorized user grants it access through HealthVault. HealthVault allows you to control access by accepting or denying requests. For each service granted access, you choose what health information in a specific health record to share and what actions each service may perform on the health information. A service you authorize for a record will get the full name associated with your HealthVault account, the nickname of the authorized record(s), and your relationship to that record. The service will continue to have access through HealthVault until you revoke the permission. Microsoft can revoke a service's access to HealthVault if it does not meet its privacy commitments to Microsoft. However, except for applying the access permissions you have granted to third-party services, we do not control or monitor third-party services, and their privacy practices will vary.", "summary": "**Sharing health data**. A key value of HealthVault is the ability you have to share your health data with people and services that can help you meet your health-related goals. By default, you are the custodian of any records you create. Custodians have the highest level of access to a health record. As a custodian, you can share data in a health record with another person by sending an e-mail invitation through HealthVault. You can specify what type of access they have (including custodian access), how long they have access, and whether they can modify the data in the record. When you grant someone access, that person can grant the same level of access to someone else (for example, someone with view-only access can grant another user view-only access). **Because inappropriate granting of access could allow someone to violate your privacy or even revoke your access to your own records, you should be cautious about granting access to your records.**"}
