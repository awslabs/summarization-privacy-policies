{"text": " The information that we collect about you while you are using our Services falls into two general categories: information you provide to us, and information that is automatically collected. All of the information we collect may be collected directly by us, or it may be collected by a vendor providing contractual services to us, such as a service provider. 1\\. _Information You Provide to Us_. We may collect and store information that you voluntarily supply to us while using our Services, including information you send to us by email or other platforms in connection with a feature provided through the Services. This may include information that can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone numbers, birthdate and gender. Some examples of this type of information include: * information that you electronically submit when you contact us with questions or participate in contests, surveys or sweepstakes; * information that you post on blogs, discussion forums or other community posting and social networking areas accessed through our Services; * information and content you provide when you upload a photograph, video or audio file; * information that you electronically submit when you complete an online registration form to access and use certain features of our Services; * information that you provide within an advertisement on one of our Services; and * information contained in search requests that you submit through our Services. We also may ask for information (including a credit card number and other financial information) from those users who make purchases or have payment transactions through our Services. 2\\. _Information that is Automatically Collected_. We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you use our Services. Some examples of this type of information include: * whether you downloaded an App; * the source of the download of the App (for example, through a particular advertisement for the App); * your Device.s connection to the Internet; * your browser or operating system; .which pages you visit through our Services and how often; * which features of our Services you interact with and how often; * which advertisements we serve to you and your engagement with them; and * information generated when you upload a photograph, video or audio file. In addition, certain Devices and browsers contain unique identifiers that can be used to identify other information about your Device. When you use such a Device or browser to access our Services, your Device and/or your browser may automatically collect and/or transmit your Device's unique identifier, IP address, MAC address, profile information (if you connect through a social network such as Facebook), location information, the make and model of your Device, the wireless provider associated with your Device, and similar information. We may ask you whether we may access and collect your location information even when you are not using the Services, but you may decline this request. We also may use a standard feature found in browser software called a \"cookie\" to enhance your experience with our Services. Cookies are small files that your web browser or an App places on your Device for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the Services or other websites, cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique users visit us, and track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences for certain Services when you have entered preference information before. We also may use web beacons (single-pixel graphic files also known as \"transparent GIFs\") to access cookies and to count users who use the Services or other websites. Additionally, we may assign an anonymous identifier to the tracking pixel or session cookie. We, along with third parties, may use other kinds of technologies, such as local storage, in connection with our Services. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings (see below). The method for disabling local storage will vary depending on your browser and device. 3\\. _Your Choices_. When we request information from you through our Services, you may always choose not to provide us with that information. But if you decline to supply or provide us with certain information while using our Services, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through our Services. If you want to limit the information that is automatically collected while you use our Services or other websites, most web browsers allow you to disable certain functionality or set certain privacy settings. If you choose to disable cookies or turn off other functionality, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through the Services. You can stop all future collection of information by the Apps by uninstalling the Apps according to the procedures outlined in the Apps or on your Device. 4\\. _Collection of Information by Service Providers and Third-Party Advertising Service Providers_. In addition, our service providers and third-party advertising service providers may use their own cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect the information listed above from our Services. The data collected in connection with the ad serving and ad targeting through our Services does not include your name, postal address, email address, telephone number, birthdate or gender unless you affirmatively provide information within the ad. However, it may include Device identifying information such as the IP address, MAC address, cookie or other Device-specific unique ID. These service providers also may assign an anonymous identifier to the tracking pixel or session cookie. The collection of information by our service providers and third-party advertising service providers is governed by their relevant privacy notices, for which we have no responsibility or liability, and are not covered by our Privacy Notice. If you have any questions regarding the privacy notice of one of our service providers, you should contact the service provider directly for more information.

{"text": " As a Spreadshirt customer, so if you order something in our online shop (see Section 2.2 a), we process the email address you provide in order to send you regular email recommendations for products that might be of interest to you based on your previous orders from us. We also use your name to allow us to personalise these emails. The data is passed on to the software company Emarsys (see Section 2.6 a), which handles the technical side of the mailing on our behalf. The legal bases are Section 7(3) of the German Act against Unfair Competition (UWG) and Art. 6(1) Sentence 1(f) GDPR. You receive these product recommendations because you did not object to the use of your email address for this purpose by removing the corresponding check mark during the order process. If you subsequently no longer wish to receive product recommendations or any advertising messages, you can object at any time without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs at the basic rates. Just click on the unsubscribe link included with each email, send a message using the contact details provided under Section 1 or – if you have a user account with us – adjust your newsletter settings accordingly (“Account settings” - “Newsletter subscriptions”). When sending the product recommendations, we use Emarsys to statistically evaluate your user behaviour in order to measure their success and to optimise their design. The legal bases for the processing are Art. 6(1) Sentences 1(a) and (f) GDPR. To enable this evaluation, the emails contain what are called web beacons or tracking pixels. These are single-pixel image files that establish a connection to our website und thus permit a log file analysis. The web beacons are linked with the data mentioned in Section 2.1 a and an individual ID. The links contained in the email also contain this ID. For example, we can see if and when an email has been opened and which links have been clicked on. The data is stored on the Emarsys servers for 13 months and collected pseudonymously, meaning the IDs are not linked to other personal data at this point, thus ruling out any possibility of direct personal reference. You can object to the recording of your usage behaviour at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link provided in each email, informing us via the contact options listed in Section 1, or – if you have a user account with us – changing the newsletter settings in your user account (“Account settings” – “Newsletter subscriptions”).

{"text": " Technical Information. When you use the MLBAM Properties, we use software tools, including but not limited to cookies (small amounts of data which include a unique string of characters sent to your browser or application from a website's computers and stored on your computer's or device's hard drive), web beacons (technology used to track activity, also known as pixel tags) and similar technologies, to collect a variety of information, for example the IP address of the computer or device used to access an MLBAM Property, the type of Internet browser or operating system used to access an MLBAM Property, the date and duration of a Website visit or the Internet Protocol address used to access the Website. We use such technical information for internal purposes, for example to study and improve the response times of our Website. We may associate such technical information with personal information you provide to us as described in Section 1 above, in which case we will treat such associated information as personal information. Please be advised that associating technical information with personal information may be required for us, and our Service Providers, to recognize you and your communications with us, for example to retain your newsletter preferences or enable your use of a \"shopping cart.\"   Customers within the EEA will be asked for consent prior to the setting of cookies. Location Data. When you use an MLBAM Property via a wireless device we may solicit your permission to collect your location data. Some features within our Applications (e.g., live MLB game video or location-based offers) may only function upon confirmation of your location, and therefore such features will not be available if you choose not to provide your location data to us. The specificity of the location data collected may depend on a number of factors, including the device you are using (e.g., laptop, smartphone, tablet) and how you are connected to the Internet (e.g., via cable broadband connection, WiFi). If you enable location services for our Applications, we may collect location data (e.g., zip code) periodically as you use or leave open our Applications. We use such location information for internal purposes and to improve your MLBAM Property experience, for example to understand where our users are most successfully accessing the MLBAM Properties. We may associate such location information with personal information you provide to us as described in Section 1 above, in which case we will treat such associated information as personal information. Depending on the platform you use to access our Applications (e.g., Apple's iOS, Google's Android) you may be able to control whether location data is collected from within \"Settings\" or other controls on your wireless device or the Applications. Our Access to Your Contacts. When you use our Games, we may solicit your permission to access your contacts list (e.g., address book) so you can be matched with individuals from your contacts lists who participate in our Games and you can invite your friends to play. We will not store the information in your contacts list except to manage your Game invitations. Third Party Cookies and Web Beacons; Network Advertisers. We allow and use select third parties, such as those who deliver advertisements, content, social networking or provide other services associated with the MLBAM Properties to collect data and/or serve ads when you visit MLBAM Properties. Network advertisers may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to MLBAM Properties in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. This may happen through permission given to such third parties to set cookies, web beacons or similar technologies in certain locations within the MLBAM Properties, including but not limited to certain of our emails. Third party companies that manage and deliver advertisements to websites and applications such as ours are commonly referred to as \"network advertisers.\" A permitted network advertiser may use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies to collect information about your interaction with the MLBAM Properties in order to tailor certain advertisements and content delivered within the MLBAM Properties and on other websites within such network advertiser's ad network. These companies may also use non-cookie technologies to recognize your computer or device and/or to collect and record information about your web surfing activity including your activities on or off MLBAM Properties. Please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these non-cookie technologies, and those browser settings that block cookies may have no effect on such techniques. You may learn more about network advertising industry practices and opt out of targeted behavioral advertising from many major third party network advertisers and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies via the information and tools available [here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) and [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/). In order to avoid providing your email address to network advertisers for the activity carried out about to be possible, we use a third party to convert your email address into a unique code (hashed email address), which is then provided to the advertiser. Other Advertising. We share certain data with Social Networks (as defined below) such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Snapchat to allow us to target existing users and customers with highly relevant advertising campaigns. We will not share your name, address, email address or telephone number for the purposes of such campaigns. Instead, a unique code (hashed email address) is shared with the applicable Social Network in order for that identifier to be matched against existing users of the relevant social network and to identify potentially relevant audiences for targeted advertising. We use services such as Linkedin Matched Audiences and Facebook Custom Audiences for these purposes. If you do not wish to receive advertisements in this way, please follow the links in the paragraph above. In addition to advertisements for our own goods and services, we may also facilitate third parties to advertise their own goods and services including through targeting those advertisements to those that might be most interested in them. These advertisements may be shown within our Games. This is done using information which does not include your name, address, email address or telephone number and we won't hand over or sell any of your personal information to third party advertisers. In order to provide advertisements relevant to you, your IP address will be used, as well as your operating system and device type. Information about your particular device will be used to show you advertisements which work properly on that device. Social Networking. When using the MLBAM Properties or when using certain third party social networking services (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Google +) (each a \"Social Network\"), you may have the option to connect your MLBAM Property information and activity with your Social Network information and activity. If you authorize such a connection, you permit us to share or publish information about your MLBAM Property activity with that Social Network and its users, and to access certain of your Social Network information, as disclosed to you at the time you consent to the connection. Information we may share with a Social Network may include, but is not limited to: technical information about your MLBAM Property activity, your MLBAM Property comments or the videos you watch on MLBAM Properties. Information we may access about you, with your consent, from a Social Network may include, but is not limited to, your basic Social Network information, your location data, your list of contacts, friends or followers and certain information about your activities on the Social Network. If you permit a connection between a Social Network and an MLBAM Property, we (and that Social Network) may be able to identify you and to associate information received pursuant to the connection with information we already have about you. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policy and privacy control options of any Social Network with which you choose to share information or connect to an MLBAM Property. Device ID. When you use certain MLBAM Properties, we or our Service Provider may collect your unique device ID. We may use such information for internal purposes and to provide you a better MLBAM Property experience, for example to troubleshoot Application problems you may experience or provide you rewards or offers in connection with your Game activity. We may associate Device ID with personal information you provide to us as described in Section 1 above, in which case we will treat such associated information as personal information. You may learn more about our Service Provider for Mobile Games and opt out of any anonymous Device ID collection via the privacy settings available within your mobile device.", "summary": "#### 3\\.

These applications and services use various location technologies (including Global Positioning Satellite (“GPS”), Assisted GPS (“AGPS”), cell ID and enhanced cell ID technologies) to identify the approximate location of a device, which is then used in conjunction with the application to enhance the user’s experience (for example, to provide driving directions, to provide enhanced 411 Directory Assistance or search results, etc.).LBS may, or may not, involve any interaction with or dependency on our supplier’s network, and location-based services may or may not look to our network to obtain location data. Where our network supplier allows third parties the capability of accessing data about your location that is derived from our supplier’s network, our network supplier requires those third parties to observe specific privacy and security protections consistent with this policy. It is important that you understand the location capabilities and settings of your device, and that you carefully read and understand the terms under which these services are provided – whether by us or another entity.

{"text": " Last updated: July 9, 2014 Leading Edge Marketing, Inc., a Bahamas corporation (\"LEM\") recognizes the importance of your privacy. Please take a moment to review how LEM collects and uses your information in our privacy policy (\"Privacy Policy\"). Your Privacy Rights: * LEM ACTS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE CAN-SPAM ACT, THE CALIFORNIA ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT, THE CALIFORNIA \"SHINE THE LIGHT\" LAW, AND THE DIRECT MARKETING ASSOCIATION (DMA) PRIVACY PROMISE. * We do NOT collect information about your general browsing behavior on the net. * We do NOT know any of your internet search queries except for those that land you on our domains. * We will NEVER spam you, and our third-party affiliate marketers are strictly forbidden to spam. By \"spam,\" we mean the sending of bulk, unsolicited e-mail. If you receive spam containing an ad for one of our products, contact us at once. We will terminate the affiliate from our marketing program immediately. * We are informed when someone clicks on ads on other sites, but the only information we have is the number of ad views. We do NOT know the identity of the site on which the ad was clicked, unless it is the immediate page before you land on our site. * Besides our own website pages, the only page we will ever know you visited is the specific page from which you arrive (if applicable). * We do NOT have discretionary access to your credit card information. Your credit card information is in a locked system, held by a certified Level 1, PCI-compliant third-party processor, for strict data security. If you make multiple purchases, their locked system will conduct the transactions. We do NOT have access to any part of the stored information, and we do NOT see the credit card numbers. There are strict obligations that govern credit card merchants' handling of personal data, and we cannot be held responsible for actions by this third party. We accept no liability for loss and/or damage that you may suffer as a result of this third party's acts and/or omissions. We advise you to print and retain a copy of each card transaction for future reference. * Your order is shipped discreetly in a plain package with a shipping label that does NOT identify the contents. * The purchasing, processing, and shipping of any product on the internet requires the buyer to provide certain data such as a name, shipping address, email address, and often a phone or fax number (we'll call that \"Provided Information\"). Such data are gathered via the website order page, mail or fax forms, or telephone order, and this information may be stored by LEM. * The Provided Information is transmitted from your web browser to our order processing system using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). With this communication protocol, all Provided Information is encrypted prior to transmission over the Internet, and NOT sent as readable text. There is an inherent risk that any communication, whether by e-mail, fax, telephone, or post, however, can be intercepted by third-parties, and we cannot accept liability for that. * Follow-up communications from LEM will ordinarily be limited to an order confirmation by e-mail, customer service replies to questions you pose, newsletter mailings (from which you may naturally and easily opt-out at any time), occasional promotional offers (from which you may also naturally and easily opt-out at any time), the reset of your password if you so request, and perhaps a customer satisfaction survey. If you would like to opt out of receiving newsletters and/or promotional mailings, not only can you unsubscribe at any time, but also can already opt out [here](mailto:yourprivacyrights@leminternet.com). Unless you opt out here or unsubscribe later, you shall be deemed to have given affirmative consent to receive such. * The Provided Information may be shared with select third-parties, who may notify you about products or services that they believe to be appropriate for you. If you wish to opt-out, you are welcome to use the contact information listed below to tell us. * When non-personal information about you runs through servers and other mechanical devices to effectuate your transaction, we do NOT use it for any purpose other than completing the transaction and, potentially, for placing cookies so that ads might appear when you visit sites relevant to LEM products. We do NOT know the sites you are visiting when ads appear. (You can block cookies by changing settings on your computer.) * Just as with any other company, Provided Information might have to be disclosed to a court of competent jurisdiction or a law enforcement agency if validly demanded, or may have to be disclosed in the course of a lawsuit, or supplied to a doctor or medical authority for your protection in the event of a health risk. * Just as with any other company, our shipper will have access to that limited portion of your Provided Information necessary for sending you the product. The shipper is bound by a confidentiality agreement with us, and subject to applicable confidentiality statutes. * In the event that our business is sold, Provided Information may be conveyed to the buyer, but the buyer will be obligated to honor this Privacy Policy", "summary": "# SellHealth.com - Your Privacy Rights"}

By means of this addition, Google shortens and anonymizes the IP address of the Internet connection of the person concerned if access takes place from a member state of the European Union or from another state party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyse the flow of visitors to our website. Google uses the data and information collected to evaluate the use of our website, among other things, to compile online reports for us that show the activities on our website and to provide other services in connection with the use of our website. Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned. By setting the cookie, Google is enabled to analyse the use of our website. Each time one of the individual pages of this website, which is operated by ASEA and on which a Google Analytics component has been integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the person concerned is automatically prompted by the respective Google Analytics component to transmit data to Google for the purpose of online analysis. As part of this technical process, Google obtains knowledge of personal data, such as the IP address of the person concerned, which serves Google, among other things, to trace the origin of visitors and clicks and subsequently enable commission statements. Cookies are used to store personal information, such as access time, the location from which access came and the frequency of visits to our website by the person concerned. Whenever you visit our website, this personal data, including the IP address of the Internet connection used by the person concerned, is transmitted to Google in the United States of America. This personal data is stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may disclose personal data collected through the technical process to third parties. The person concerned can prevent the setting of cookies by our website at any time, as already described above, by means of an appropriate setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies . Such a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from placing a cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned. In addition, a cookie already set by Google Analytics can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs. Furthermore, it is possible for the person concerned to object to and prevent the collection of data generated by Google Analytics relating to the use of this website and the processing of this data by Google. To do this, the person concerned must download and install a browser add-on from the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout This browser add-on informs Google Analytics via JavaScript that no data and information on visits to websites may be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-on is considered a contradiction by Google. If the person’s information technology system is deleted, formatted or reinstalled at a later time, the person concerned must reinstall the browser add-on to disable Google Analytics. If the browser add-on is uninstalled or deactivated by the person concerned or another person within their control, it is possible to reinstall or reactivate the browser add-on. Further information and Google’s current privacy policy can be found at https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/ and http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html Google Analytics will be explained in more detail under this link https://www.google.com/intl/de_en/analytics/. The processing within the framework of Google Analytics serves ASEA to measure and evaluate visitor flows on our website in order to obtain an exact overview of visitor numbers, usage interests and other relevant information for the design of the company structures and the website. This is in the legitimate interest of ASEA, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO.", "summary": "### Privacy policy for the use and application of Google Analytics (with anonymisation function)"}

{"text": " Polar Club is a heart rate-based group fitness and exercise app that enables tracking and displaying club members' real-time performance data, such as heart rate, intensity and calories burned, during an exercise class. The participants’ workout summaries will automatically upload to Polar Flow where they can keep track of their progress and reach their goals. When a fitness club purchases Polar Club, it signs an agreement with Polar. Under this agreement, Polar acts as the data processor while the club is the data controller. The club is responsible for what information is saved in the system and how it is handled. The club is also responsible for the accuracy of the users’ information and data-related requests by individual users (such as requests to delete the information). Information on the clubs that use the service is collected in the Polar Club register. A username is created for the administrator designated by the club (Club Admin). For this, the person’s email address is saved in the system. Information on exercise classes is stored on the club’s iPad for a month. Other data saved on the device includes the participants’ training-related data and an electronic ID code to identify the individuals, which can be used to connect the username used in the registration to the Flow database. With this ID code, participants’ training data can be transferred to their personal Flow account. The club’s staff cannot identify users on the basis of these ID codes. The instructor’s ID data is also stored on the iPad. Participants’ actual Flow usernames are not stored on the iPad. All the user information stored under the Flow username is located in the Flow service, and the club does not have access to these accounts. The Polar Flow service’s data is saved on Polar’s service provider’s servers. These servers may be located either within the EU or outside it. Read more about data transfer and related protective mechanisms here. Customers may participate in exercise classes via their existing Flow account, by creating an account in conjunction with signing up for the class, or by signing up as a Visitor. Customers with a Flow account: The customer can sign up for a Club exercise class using an existing Flow account. Alternatively, the user can create a Flow account in conjunction with signing up. No personal information provided in connection with the creation of the Flow account is stored on the iPad. The only information stored on the iPad is the participants’ electronic ID and exercise data. The exercise data of the customers who use their Flow account to sign up for the class is automatically transferred from the club’s iPad to the Polar Flow service using the ID code. Customers who sign up as a Visitor: Customers may also sign up for Club exercise classes as a Visitor, in which case the participants provide a name they want to have displayed on the screen during the class, such as a nickname or any other ID (e.g. a word or a string of characters). No personal information is collected or saved. Participants who signed up as Visitors may store their exercise data after the class by creating a Flow account or using an existing Flow account. The Polar Club solution also offers clubs and their customers a channel for discussing the exercise classes and other similar matters within the club’s own community. The Community service can be found in Flow’s _Community -_ _Clubs_ section. When participating in discussions in the service, the participants may share information related to them if they so wish. When necessary, the club is responsible for moderating the discussions.

{"text": " Any time you use Oracle’s Sites or Services, information is generated. Some of this information is considered “Personal Information,” meaning information that either directly identifies you individually (like your name, address, email, or billing information) or could reasonably be used to identify you in combination with other data. Other information is considered “Anonymous Information,” meaning information that does not directly identify, and cannot reasonably be linked with other data to identify you individually. Oracle collects information from you in the following ways: A. YOU GIVE IT TO US When you visit or use our Sites or use our Services, you may provide us with information. For example, when downloading an Oracle whitepaper or setting up a new DynID account, we will prompt you to provide us with your name, physical address, email address and phone number. B. WE RECEIVE IT FROM THIRD PARTIES Oracle engages with third party vendors to try to determine new customers who might be interested in Oracle’s Dyn Services. In such instances third parties may give Oracle your name and contact information. C.  WE AUTOMATICALLY COLLECT IT FROM YOU While visiting our Sites or using our Services, we may automatically collect information from you through the use of cookies, web server logs, and other mechanisms.  For example, when you visit a Site, we automatically collect device identifiers (e.g., device model, operating system, browser version, and other data that may be used to identify a device), IP addresses, device configurations, browser history, information about Site usage, and geographic location data. NOTE ON CROSS BORDER TRANSFERS: Oracle has established a global network presence and may process information on our servers in many countries around the world, including the United States. You agree that we may process information on a server located outside the country where you reside. NOTE ON CHILDREN’S PERSONAL INFORMATION: Oracle does not knowingly collect any personal information (as defined under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected or received personal from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe that we might have such information, please contact us at the contact information provided below.

Web beacons collect information, such as identifiers, time and date of access, and descriptions of the pages or communications in which the web beacons are embedded. We may use cookies or web beacons on the Sites or in communications sent through the Services for various purposes, including for example: * Saving user preferences; * Customizing content of the Site for individual users; * Ensuring that users are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads; * Recording session information; * Fraud prevention; * Saving certain information about users of the Sites and others who visit the Sites; * Keeping track of whether you’ve had a chance to open an email or view an advertisement; and * Otherwise facilitating and enhancing interaction with the Sites.
